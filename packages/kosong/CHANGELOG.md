# Changelog

## Unreleased

## 0.53.0 (2026-04-28)

- Kimi: Fix stale API key after OAuth token refresh — `on_retryable_error` now reads the current `api_key` from the live client instead of the cached `_api_key`, so that OAuth token refreshes applied via `client.api_key` are preserved when the client is rebuilt after a retryable error

## 0.52.0 (2026-04-24)

- Kimi: Add `keep` to `ThinkingConfig` (Moonshot `thinking.keep` passthrough for Preserved Thinking); value is typed as `Any` and forwarded unchanged, with case-preservation and no validation — callers choose a value the server accepts (e.g. `"all"`)
- Kimi: Fix `with_extra_body` silently dropping earlier `thinking.*` fields on subsequent calls — the `thinking` sub-dict is now merged field-by-field so composing `with_thinking(...)` with `with_extra_body({"thinking": {...}})` preserves both contributions; other top-level keys retain last-writer-wins semantics
- Kimi: Normalize MCP tool parameter schemas before sending to Moonshot — properties that declare `enum`/`const` but no `type` (or have no type hint at all) get an inferred `type` filled in, so MCP servers whose schemas are valid JSON Schema but not strict enough for Moonshot's validator (notably the JetBrains Rider MCP, whose `truncateMode` property is enum-only) no longer make every request fail with `400 At path 'properties.X': type is not defined`; the normalization is Kimi-specific and leaves OpenAI/Anthropic conversions untouched
- Kimi: Fix sending empty `content` alongside `tool_calls`, which caused 400 "text content is empty" errors from the Moonshot API. When an assistant message has tool calls and its visible content is effectively empty (no text or only whitespace/think parts), the `content` field is now omitted entirely

## 0.51.0 (2026-04-22)
- Anthropic: Fix parallel tool results being split into multiple user messages — consecutive tool-result-only user messages are now merged into a single message, complying with the Anthropic Messages API spec that all `tool_use` blocks in an assistant turn must be answered within one user message; this fixes 400 errors on strict Anthropic-compatible backends (e.g. DeepSeek `/anthropic` endpoint) and prevents the official backend from silently teaching the model to avoid parallel tool calls

## 0.50.0 (2026-04-17)

- Anthropic: Add adaptive thinking support for Claude Opus 4.7 — model capability detection now uses regex version extrapolation (covers `opus-4-7`, Bedrock/Vertex name variants such as `aws/claude-opus-4-7` and `anthropic.claude-opus-4-7-v1:0`, `claude-mythos-preview`, and future Claude versions ≥ 4.6) instead of hard-coded substring matching; adaptive requests now set `display: "summarized"` explicitly so thinking content still streams on Opus 4.7 (where the default flipped to `"omitted"`); the legacy `thinking: {type: "enabled", budget_tokens: N}` path is no longer used for Opus 4.7, which rejects it with 400
- Anthropic: Plumb `output_config.effort` through both adaptive and legacy paths — the user-requested effort was previously dropped in adaptive mode, silently collapsing `low`/`medium` to the model default; effort is now faithfully forwarded, and on legacy paths it is emitted only for models that Anthropic's docs explicitly list as supporting the parameter (Opus 4.5 on top of all adaptive-capable models) to avoid 400 validation errors on Claude 3.x and other models that reject `output_config`
- Core: Extend `ThinkingEffort` with `xhigh` and `max` — new tiers available on Opus 4.7 (`xhigh`), Opus 4.6 / Sonnet 4.6 / Claude Mythos Preview (`max`), and OpenAI models after `gpt-5.1-codex-max` (`xhigh`); providers clamp unsupported levels down transparently (e.g., `xhigh` → `high` on Opus 4.6, `max` → `xhigh` on OpenAI, `xhigh`/`max` → `high` on Gemini and Kimi)

## 0.49.0 (2026-04-10)

- Core: Treat think-only model responses (reasoning content with no text or tool calls) as incomplete response errors, enabling automatic retry instead of silently stopping the agent loop
- OpenAI: Fix crash on streaming mid-flight disconnection — classify base `openai.APIError` (body=None) as retryable via heuristic message matching, so that `_run_with_connection_recovery` and tenacity retry logic correctly trigger instead of crashing

## 0.48.0 (2026-04-02)

- Google GenAI: Add `default_headers` parameter to `GoogleGenAI` constructor — custom headers are merged into `HttpOptions` so they are included in all API requests

## 0.47.0 (2026-03-30)

- OpenAI: Fix implicit `reasoning_effort` causing 400 errors — auto-set `reasoning_effort` to `"medium"` when history contains `ThinkPart` and the parameter wasn't explicitly set

## 0.46.0 (2026-03-25)

- Google GenAI: Fix `FunctionCall` and `FunctionResponse` wire format — remove `id` field from outbound messages as Gemini API returns HTTP 400 when it is included; internal `tool_call_id` tracking remains unchanged
- Core: Use `json.loads(strict=False)` when parsing tool call arguments to tolerate unescaped control characters from LLM output
- Core: Treat `httpx.ProtocolError` as `APIConnectionError` in shared `convert_httpx_error()` mapping so streaming protocol disconnects now participate in existing retry logic
- Anthropic: Fix `httpx.ReadTimeout` leaking through `_convert_stream_response` during streaming — the exception is now caught and converted to `APITimeoutError`, enabling retry logic that was previously bypassed
- Anthropic: Fix `_convert_error` ordering — `AnthropicAPITimeoutError` is now checked before `AnthropicAPIConnectionError` to avoid misclassification due to inheritance
- Core: Add shared `convert_httpx_error()` utility for converting httpx transport errors to `ChatProviderError` subtypes, used by all providers
- Google GenAI: Add `httpx.HTTPError` catch in `_convert_stream_response` for the httpx fallback transport path

## 0.45.0 (2026-03-11)
