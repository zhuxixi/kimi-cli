"""
Telemetry event tracking for kimi-cli.

This module has NO dependencies on other kimi_cli modules to avoid import cycles.
track() can be called at any point during startup, even before the sink is attached.
Events are buffered in memory and flushed once the sink is ready.

Usage:
    from kimi_cli.telemetry import track, set_context, attach_sink

    # Early in startup — events queue in memory
    track("first_launch")

    # After app init — attach sink to start flushing
    set_context(device_id="abc", session_id="def")
    attach_sink(sink)
